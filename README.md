# Spectra Tutorial

This Spectra Tutorial has been developedCode as a technical briefing for ICSE 2021. 

This repository contains examples of specification used in a series of videos available in a YouTube playlist: [Reactive Synthesis with Spectra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGyeoukah9Nbx1QquUmZGdLulFZIsiRlZ). Each module contains an introduction (linked video), a task (explained in the video), example code (in this repository to be imported as Eclipse projects), and a solution (second linked video).

We suggest going through the modules in the following order (order of the playlist above):
* [0a] Reactive synthesis with Spectra [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHYFRMfK2pg&list=PLGyeoukah9Nbx1QquUmZGdLulFZIsiRlZ&index=1)
* [0b] Installation and Import [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smDcuR3NP44&list=PLGyeoukah9Nbx1QquUmZGdLulFZIsiRlZ&index=2)

* [L1] Write your first specification [folder](L1_firstSpec)
* [A1] Synthesize your first controller [folder](A1_firstController)
* [E1] Basic step-by-step simulation [folder](E1_simulation)

* [L2] Advanced language constructs [folder](L2_defsArrays)
* [A2] Unrealizability [folder](A2_unrealizability)
* [E2] Execute your reactive system [folder](E2_execution)

* [L3] Advanced language constructs [folder](L3_patterns)
* [A3] Non-well-separation [folder](A3_wellseparation)
* [E3] Advanced step-by-step simulation [folder](E3_simulation_advanced)
